# CHANGELOG

## 1.2.1 - 2017-08-18

* Reverted grep command to its original behavior

## 1.2.0 - 2017-07-23

### Added

* Added command create that creates a new changelog file with the standard header.
* Added command entry that adds a quick entry to the latest tag in the changelog file.
* Added command next that creates a new unreleased header in the changelog file.

### Fixed

* When creating a tag the tag annotation does now preserve markdown headers
  that were previously interpreted by git as comments and therefore stripped.

## 1.1.4 - 2017-01-06

* Fixed a problem with GNU grep where `chag contents` was unable to find
  entries.
* Now vendoring bats when testing.

## 1.1.3 - 2015-05-29

* Fixed an issue when searching for a tag using grep was matching tags that
  started with the same number. This could cause issues when you have tags
  like `3.0.0` and `3.0.0-beta.1`. Searching for tags now uses a more exact
  search in order to prevent these types of collisions.

## 1.1.2 - 2015-05-19

* Fixed an issue where searching for a tag using grep was matching dots as a
  regular expression dot, which provided false positives. Dots in tag names
  are now escaped when searching for tags.

## 1.1.1 - 2015-02-15

* Auto-detect CHANGELOG and CHANGELOG.md when no `--file` is provided.
* Adding missing `update` usage information to `chag --help`.

## 1.1.0 - 2014-10-28

* Removed the `--debug` option from the tag command.
* Removed the `--notrim` option from the contents command.
* Simplified a great deal and updated docs.

## 1.0.0 - 2014-10-26

* Using the format from http://keepachangelog.com
* Trimming down the feature set and switching back to bash instead of Python.
  This makes chag much simpler to install and does not require any
  dependencies.
* Simplified by removing `chag new`, `chag append`, and `chag get`.

## 0.5.0 - 2014-08-16

## 0.2.0 - 2014-08-11
