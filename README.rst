*chag* (pronounced ``'chag``) stands for "changelog tag". It allows you to
use your project's changelog as the canonical source of change data.

What does it do?
----------------

1. Parse the contents of a specific changelog entry by tag name.
2. Create annotated git tags based on a changelog entry.
3. List all available tag version numbers in a changelog.
4. Get the version number of the latest changelog entry in a changelog.
5. In-place update a WIP changelog entry with an actual version number.

Why use chag?
-------------

1. Use your hand-curated changelog file as the canonical source of change
   information that can be easily parsed and shared in other locations
   (e.g., annotated tags, GitHub releases, etc.).
2. By using annotated tags with changelog contents, you can use your GitHub
   releases atom feed to keep your users up to date on releases. Take a look at
   `chag's atom feed <https://github.com/mtdowling/chag/releases.atom>`_ for
   an example.
3. If you use `Travis CI's deploy feature <http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases/>`_
   to automatically deploy to GitHub releases, then the contents of your GitHub
   releases will mirror the contents of the corresponding changelog entry.
4. Helps to ensure your changelog is always up to date.

Workflow
--------

While you can use any of the commands of chag as needed, the recommended
chag workflow is:

1. As you develop changes, add to your changelog file under a changelog
   section titled ``Unreleased``.
    * You can run ``chag create`` to create a ``CHANGELOG.md`` file if one does not exist.
    * Next, to create a new "Unreleased" entry, run ``chag next``.
2. As you develop features, append items to your changelog.
    * You can do this by running ``chag entry --contents <your entry>``
3. When your work is ready to be released, execute ``chag update X.Y.Z``
   to update the WIP changelog entry to an actual version number. Substitute
   ``X.Y.Z`` with the version of the next tagged release.
4. Review the changes and commit them.
5. Run ``chag tag`` to create an annotated git tag based on the most recent
   changelog entry found in your changelog file.

Installation
------------

chag is just a single bash script. You need to add it to your path in order to
use it. One easy installation method is through cURL using the following:

::

    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtdowling/chag/master/install.sh | bash

You can customize the install source, directory and profile using the
CHAG_DIR and CHAG_VERSION environment variables. The script will place chag
in /usr/local/bin by default.

You can also install chag by cloning the repository and placing it somewhere
in your path manually.

Changelog Format
----------------

chag uses the changelog format described by
`keepachangelog.com <http://keepachangelog.com>`_. You are free to include any
content before the first changelog entry in the file. Each changelog entry MUST
start with an H2 markdown string ``## ``, followed by the version number of the
entry. The contents of a changelog entry can be anything you'd like.

Example Changelog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    # CHANGELOG

    Any text can occur before the actual release not entries are found.

    ## Unreleased

    * I've been building up this release while developing.
    * This helps to ensure the changelog is up to date.

    ## 1.0.1 - 2014-09-10

    Optional description of the release notes.

    * Updated something or another.
    * Here is another bullet point.

    ## 1.0.1 - 2014-09-01

    * Some bullet point data.

See chag's `CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/mtdowling/chag/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_
